        <section>
            <h2>Orchards & Varieties</h2>
            <p>
                Our macadamia trees thrive alongside coffee in the rich volcanic soils of Mount Kenya. We cultivate select varieties—Macadamia integrifolia and Tetraphylla—for their creamy texture and high oil content, ensuring exceptional taste and crunch in every nut.

            <h2>Harvest & Shelling</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hand-Picking</strong> — Each nut is picked at peak ripeness for maximum flavor and nutrition.</li>
                <li><strong>Gentle Cracking</strong> — Our mechanical crackers preserve kernel integrity, minimizing damage and waste.</li>
                <li><strong>Careful Sorting</strong> — Nuts are hand-graded for size, color, and quality before further processing.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Drying & Storage</h2>
            <p>
                We sun-dry macadamias to the perfect moisture content, locking in natural oils and sweetness. Our climate-controlled stores ensure that nuts remain fresh and crunchy until packed.

            <h2>Packing & Export</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Local Packs</strong> — Fresh, vacuum-sealed packs for home and gifting.</li>
                <li><strong>Bulk Export</strong> — Carefully graded kernels for international buyers, with full traceability and quality certifications.</li>

        <section>
            <h2>Sustainability</h2>
            <p>
                Our macadamia trees are intercropped with coffee and indigenous species, enriching soil, providing shade, and supporting pollinators. This agroforestry approach boosts land resilience and farm biodiversity.
